"""How fast the model runs, and a floor it must not fall through.

Not a benchmark for its own sake. A model of a processor is only useful if it can
be driven for long enough to be interesting, and the way that stops being true is
gradual: a helper grows an allocation, a property becomes a lookup, and a year
later nothing can be swept. A floor that fails loudly is cheaper than noticing.

The floor is deliberately far below what the model does today. It is there to
catch something several times slower, not to police the noise between one runner
and another, because a shared runner's variance is larger than any change worth
arguing about.

Every figure is a median across repeats rather than a mean, because one scheduling
hiccup moves a mean and moves a median much less, and the runtime version is
printed beside it because it is the single thing that changes these numbers most.

Nothing here needs a program image. It runs whatever the fill puts in
front of it, which is the same work the conformance sweep does.

The floor is checked here and never from inside the test suite, because the suite
runs under a coverage tracer and the tracer costs about ten times what the model
does: 1.4 million instructions per second becomes 150 thousand. A throughput
assertion in that environment measures the tracer, passes or fails for reasons
that have nothing to do with this code, and would have to be set so low it could
not catch anything. So the tests here check the measuring, with a clock they
control, and the measurement itself is a step of its own.

Usage:
    python3 -m conformance.speed [--repeats N] [--instructions N]
